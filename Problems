Problem Summary
During testing, I noticed that the Amiga's right-side power input was not functioning. When attempting to power on the system from the right-side switch, the Amiga did not power up. However, powering it from the left side did activate the Amiga, but it continuously displayed errors on the pendant, specifically:

"Pendant Error 2" and "Pendant Error 3"

These errors would shuffle continuously

It also showed "No pendant or motor detected."

A warning appeared suggesting the CAN bus might be in a bad state

Diagnosis and Root Cause
After investigation, I found the issue was due to loose connections in the Anderson power cables:

One loose connection was found on the left-side Anderson connector, which supplies power from the battery.

Another loose connection was located on the right-side Anderson cable.

These issues likely occurred due to poor cable management and wires becoming tangled, resulting in unstable power delivery and CAN communication problems.

Solution
I resolved the problem by:

Carefully inspecting and re-securing the Anderson cable connections on both sides.

Improving the cable management to reduce wire tangling and mechanical stress.
